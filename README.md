# Imnun: Edge of the Civilized World

This VR solo RPG is my current flagship project. While I mean to develop it with Unity, I *may* use C as well a few external libraries or SDKs here and there. And when it comes to a release date, all that I can tell for now is that the most outstretched deadline I can afford is the 1st of July 2024.
